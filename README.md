Rougelike based on [Caves of Clojure](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/07/caves-of-clojure-01/#clojure-lanterna)


## Getting Started

1. Clone the project
2. Run the project via Leiningen using `lein run :swing`
You can use just `lein run`, but this mode has been less reliable for me.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Leiningen installed on your machine.
